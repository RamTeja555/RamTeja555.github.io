<p> Abstract <p>
    
    Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. 
    Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is          variable.
    
     I build the Conventional Neural netowrk model in such a way that it detect the Pneumonia status of a patient without blood test,oximeter test and     
       other. 

     The model takes a chest X-ray as an input and searched for any signs of pneumonia such as white spots in the lungs (called infiltrates) that identify      an infection. 

    This exam will also help determine if you have any complications related to pneumonia such as abscesses or pleural effusions.
